What is database ?
 central system where data will be stored in some logical related manner.
 
 software application: MySql,PstgreSql,Oracle
 software application helps us to store and manipulate the data.
 
 Types of databases:
 1. Transactional (RDBMS):MySql,PstgreSql,Oracle
 2. NoSql(Not only Sql): HBase,Cassandra, MongoDB
 
 Transactional databases:
 smallest unit of execution is known as transaction
 vertically scalable, consistent, store data in structured form or tabular form or relational form, highly available
 transactional database follows ACID properties:
 1. Atomicity: The entire transaction take place at once or doesn't happen at all.
 2. Consistency: The database must be consistent before and after the transaction 
 3. Isolation: Multiple transaction occur independently without interference.
 4. Durability: The changes of successful transaction occurs even if the system failure occurs.
 
 consistency: means if 2 or 3 users wants to fetch data from a database they will get the same result.
 
 Isolation:Each transaction will execute without impacting each other
 
 NoSql database:
 Horizonatally scalable, distributed, 
 store data in different form: key-value,columner,graph,document
 not always consistent
 highly available if no master slave architecture
